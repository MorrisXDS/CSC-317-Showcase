run the following commands in the terminal
Install essential tools
``` bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential
```
Install Cmake build tool
``` bash
    sudo apt install cmake
```

Install Version Control tool
```bash
    sudo apt install git
```

Now change directory to where you want the project to be and run
```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MorrisXDS/CSC-317-Showcase.git
    cd CSC-317-Showcase
```

build the project
```bash
    rm -rf build-release && mkdir build-release && cd build-release && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make -j$(nproc) && cd ..
    
    rm -rf build-debug && mkdir build-debug && cd build-debug && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. && make -j$(nproc) && cd ..
```

To run the program in release mode 
```bash
    cd build-release
    ./raytracing ../data/wind-dragon.json
    cd ..
```

To run the program in release mode 
```bash
    cd build-debug
    ./raytracing ../data/wind-dragon.json
    cd ..
```

Or better yet, you may run all the json files under data folder
```bash
    cd build-release
    chmod +x ../multi-run.sh
    ../multi-run.sh
    cd ..
```

To view the produced ppm files, go to the build directory which you run your program and run
For build-release
```bash
    cd build-release
    ls *.ppm
    cd ..
```
For build-debug
```bash
    cd build-debug
    ls *.ppm
    cd ..
```

#### You may check each ppm file and the ppm file generated by external stl is wind-dragon.stl
